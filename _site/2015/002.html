<h4>1.Introduction</h4>

<p class="body">Studies of the
transient flows often focus on a single-phase fluid such as highly compressible
gases, or, pure incompressible liquids, such as those classified in the category
of water hammer phenomenon. Moreover, if the elasticity of the pipe is taken
into consideration, it is assumed to be linear, with constant mechanical
properties. Unfortunately, often the elasticity property of the pipe is
neglected in the case of a gas flow, whereas, to study transitions in liquids
this property is integrated and added to the geometrical characteristics of the
pipe wall in the expression of the sound velocity. However, for pipes that
exhibit significant viscoelastic effects (for example, plastics such as PVC and
polyethylene), it has been shown that these effects can influence the wave speed in
pipes and must be accounted for if highly accurate results are desired.</p>

<p class="body">Generally, in industrial
fluids including mixed fluids of different phases, the presence of even a small
amount of free gas significantly reduces the wave velocity in comparison with
the value it would have had if the fluid was in a pure liquid state only.
Therefore, if the mixture of fluids is treated as a pseudo-fluid, the propagation of
the pressure wave is quite slow
and we cannot detect real changes of the fast flow regime if the analysis is limited
to flow velocities below the real speed of sound in the liquid. Chaudry et al.
[1] proposed to consider the gas / liquid mixture as a pseudo-fluid in the case
where the void fraction is low. Studies conducted by Henry [2] and van
Wijngaarden [3] are good references which have generated significant results on
the acoustic velocity in a bubbly flow. Hadj-Taieb [4] used mathematical models
to study transitions in a homogeneous two-phase medium. The density &#961; and
the sound velocity were assumed to be pressure dependent, and the flow quality
was assumed to remain constant. This latter condition is not always valid however.
Mori et al. [5] have conducted a study in which the void fraction is assumed to
depend on the pressure rise in a two-phase flow. Padmanabhan [6] states that
the average void fraction varies necessarily in the case where a pressure
gradient exists in a long pipe.</p>

<p class="body">In this work, we
apply the method of characteristics to investigate the transient phenomena in a
two-phase homogeneous flow. The analysis is based on models that take into
account both the mechanical parameters of the pipe like the elasticity of the
walls, and physical parameters such as the flow quality (i.e., the gaseous mass fraction of
the flow mixture, denoted as &#952;).</p>

<h4>2. Physical Model</h4>

<p class="body">The mixture considered
is a liquid carrying uniform size bubbles of gas, and is assumed to be
polytropic. The equations of continuity and momentum that are commonly used are:</p>

<div class="equation">
<img src="002_files/image002.gif" class="eqn">
<div class="eqn-number">(1)</div>
</div>

<div class="equation">
<img src="002_files/image003.gif" class="eqn">
<div class="eqn-number">(2)</div>
</div>

<p class="body">The study
consists of two parts. The first part can be referred to as a rigid model in
which the wall elasticity and the compressibility of the liquid are neglected. The
second part of the study represents a quasi-rigid model in which the elasticity
of the wall and the compressibility of the liquid are included. In both cases,
the numerical simulation tests are performed on pipes of length L = 35.7 m with
a diameter d = 0.0196 m. The friction effect is represented in terms of the
Darcy-Weisbach constant &#955;. These equations are solved by the method of
characteristics (MOC), as explained in [7, 8].</p>

<h4>3. Results</h4>

<p class="subhead">3. 1. Results for the Rigid Model Case</p>

<p class="body">In the rigid
model the elasticity of the wall is assumed to have no effect and the
compressibility of the liquid in comparison with that of the gas is neglected. The
cross sectional area of the pipe is constant and equal to S<sub>0</sub>. The
density of the homogenous mixture can be represented as:</p>

<div class="equation">
<img src="002_files/image004.gif" class="eqn">
<div class="eqn-number">(3)</div>
</div>

<p class="body">Note that the
gas in the bubbles undergoes a polytropic process due to the effect of friction,
whereby gives the following relationship:<img width=108 height=42 src="002_files/image005.gif"> The
celerity of the sound which is plotted in Figure 1 can be represented by the
following expression:</p>

</figure>


<p class="body">The comparison
between the results obtained from a study based on the current MOC method, shown
in Figure 2-a, and the numerical and experimental results of [4] depicted in
Figure 3, leads to the following observations.</p>

<p class="body">C1-Amplitude:</p>

<ul>
  <li>- In Figure 3, the amplitude of the pressure wave obtained in [4] based on a rigid model by numerical simulation using the Newton-Raphson iterative technique is around 0.7 MPa.</li>
  <li>- In experimental results the amplitude is less than 0.4 MPa as shown on the Figure 3.</li>
  <li>- Results obtained in the present investigation (MOC) depicted in Figure 2-a, is much closer to the experimental data and shows an amplitude which is around 0.37 MPa.</li>
  <li>- C2- Number of periods in 0.5s:</li>
  <li>- Also as noted in Figure 3, the numerical results of [4], show that there are 10 pressure oscillations during a time span of 0.5s. In fact, the water hammer period is shorter than the experimentally measured period, because in the homogeneous flow model as developed by the aforementioned authors the rapid expansion of the air contained in the pipe is adiabatic. The length of the water hammer period associated with polytropic exponent calibration is addressed by Sang-Gyun et al [9].</li>
  <li>- In the experimental results which are displayed in Figure 3, there are only four pressure oscillations.</li>
  <li>- Our work, in agreement with the experiments, also predicts that there are only four pressure oscillations in the 0.5s period, as shown in Figure 2-a.</li>
</ul>

<p class="body">From the aforementioned
observations C1 and C2 we can conclude that the results obtained with the
method of characteristics are closer to the experimental data and therefore
better reflect reality than the digital model of [4]. Moreover, the authors of
[4] have concluded that the rigid model they have proposed for the simulation
of a two-phase flow is not valid when the flow quality is low because the predicted
speed of sound becomes excessively high. In order to comply with the CFL
condition, the time increment dt becomes smaller and will induce a water hammer
period refinement. One may conclude that the predicted pressure amplitudes are too
high and therefore are unphysical. This is in contradiction with the classical
concept of water hammer.</p>

<p class="subhead">3. 2. Results for the Quasi-Rigid Model</p>

<p class="body">In the
quasi-rigid model case, the liquid compressibility and the pipe's elasticity are considered to be too large to be neglected. In addition, the cross-section S,
the density &#961; and the speed of sound 'a' all dependent on pressure as can
be seen in Figures 4 and 5. Usually, the pipe's elasticity is deduced from the
following equation:</p>

<div class="equation">
<img src="002_files/image011.gif" class="eqn">
<div class="eqn-number">(5)</div>
</div>

<p class="body">In which E is Young's modulus,
c is the pipe constraint factor, and e is the wall thickness.</p>

<p class="body">It is similar to the
expression that is given by [10].After integration, we find
the following expression for the cross-section S as a function of pressure p and
thereby the density of the mixture:</p>

<div class="equation">
<img src="002_files/image012.gif" class="eqn">
<div class="eqn-number">(6)</div>
</div>

<p class="body">where K<sub>l</sub> is the
compressibility of the liquid.</p>

<p class="body">As an application example, we
will use the model which has already been tested by [4] as a reference for a
validation of our simulation. Validation will be done on the classical concept
of water hammer.</p>

<p class="body">The physical problem is
defined as follows conditions: u is the fluid velocity, L=35.7 m, d=0.0196 m, E
= 0.9 10<sup>11 </sup>Pa, e = 0.001 m, c = 0.9, p<sub>e </sub>= 0.263 MPa
(Initial pressure) and Q<sub>0 </sub>= 0.000031 m<sup>3</sup>/s. The inlet mean
velocity is found from u<sub>e</sub>(x=0) = 4Q<sub>0</sub>/(&#1055; d<sup>2</sup>) and &#952; = M<sub>g</sub>/(M<sub>g</sub>+
M<sub>l</sub>) = 0 (i.e., the fluid is pure liquid free of gas), &#961; l = 1000 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, and &#961; g = 1.29 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p class="body">Figure 6 shows a validation
of the quasi-rigid model tested on the water hammer effect. When the fluid is
clean with no gaseous contamination (&#952; = 0), the evolution of the pressure wave obtained by the method
of characteristics is much close to the results obtained experimentally than that
obtained by the finite difference simulation scheme of [11].</p>

<p class="body">In conclusion, we can deduce
that the simulation of two-phase flow for the cases of rigid and quasi-rigid
models with the method of characteristic gives better results than those given
by the finite difference scheme of Lax Wendroff as presented by [4].</p>

Figure 4. Variation of the sound celerity with the
pressure. Influence of the fluid quality, &#952;.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="body">It should be noted that if E
&#8776; &#8734; then S=S<sub>0</sub> = const., and if K<sub>l</sub> &#8776;
&#8734; is also assumed, then the liquid compressibility vanishes and the
equation for the density of the liquid becomes independent of the pressure. The
model therefore will resemble the case of a rigid model.</p>

<p class="body">Generally, we
learnt from these two models that the pipe elasticity feature is crucial as it
may constitute the temporary palliative reservoir where supplementary amount of
the expanding fluid is stored in the vicinity of the triggered water hammer process.
On the other hand, Meniconi et al [12] confirmed the complete failure of
Joukowski's theory which neglects the effects of viscoelasticity of pipe
material and friction. Therefore, MOC technique has been found to be more
adaptive than the finite difference scheme of Lax Wendroff in the treatment of
the set of equations at the boundary limits, especially at the closure valve
zone.</p>

<h4>4. Impact of the Physical Parameters u<sub>e</sub>, p<sub>e</sub> and &#952;</h4>

<p class="body">Often it is assumed that the
presence of a small amount of gas in the fluid justifies the assumption that the
pipe is inelastic, and consequently the rigid model is valid. Streeter and
Wylie [13] have supported this assumption. However this issue is complicated
and the validity of the aforementioned observation depends among others on the flow
quality. To better understand this issue, we focus on the conservation
equations and in particular the continuity equation.</p>

<p class="body">The continuity equation in the steady state for a one-dimensional
flow field is:</p>

<div class="equation">
<img src="002_files/image016.gif" class="eqn">
<div class="eqn-number">(7)</div>
</div>

<p class="body">Hence</p>

<div class="equation">
<img src="002_files/image017.gif" class="eqn">
<div class="eqn-number">(8)</div>
</div>

<p class="body">Let us consider a case where the conditions at the entrance of the
pipe are as follows:</p>

<p class="body">p(x = 0) = p<sub>e</sub> =
263000 Pa, u(x=0) = u<sub>e </sub>= 0.1027 m/s and &#961; e = &#961; (p = Pa).</p>

<p class="body">The conditions mentioned
above have a crucial role in the stability of the mass balance in the pipeline.
Whalley [14] suggested that the homogeneous model can be reliable and give good
results if the mass flux satisfies G= <img
width=21 height=17 src="002_files/image018.gif"> &gt;2000 kg/(m<sup>2</sup>.s).</p>

<p class="body">Padmanabhan [6] stated that
apart from the simplicity offered by the homogenous model equation in its
implementation, this model is not the most widely recommended technique for
simulating two-phase flows. For this, the following steps will be devoted to
defining the most appropriate physical conditions for best results with the
homogeneous model. We ask the following questions: What are the physical
conditions that are favorable to the application of the homogeneous flow model
in the presence of a wave which propagates in the flow?- Also, what are the distinctions
between homogeneous and non-homogeneous flow models?</p>

<p class="body">Martin et al., [15]
and also Martin and Padmanabhan [16] assumed that the peak pressure in a
two-phase flow of a flow field which has a large void fraction, as for example
in the slug flow regime, can be easily found by solving the homogeneous flow model
equations with the method of characteristics.</p>

<p class="body">The applications of the method
of [4] in the case of a relatively high quality homogeneous flow (&#952; max = 0.0314) as presented in
the study of [6], leads to the results that are shown in Figures 7 and 8. In
the model of [4], the initial conditions are defined by p (x = 0) = p<sub>e</sub>
= 263000 Pa and u (x = 0) = u<sub>e</sub> = 0.1027 m/s, we see that for several
values of &#952;, the homogeneous density may
not exceed &#961; max = 1000 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. At &#952; max = 0.0314, corresponding to
the homogeneous case treated by [6], the density in Figure 7 appears to be
approximately constant and very low, equal only to 39.51 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. In
contrast, with a very low flow quality of &#952;<sub>min</sub> = 10<sup>-7</sup>,
the density is maximum and equal to about 1000 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. At other intermediate
values of &#952;, we notice the non-linear profile of the density.</p>

<p class="body">Changes in the
density and the sound celerity as a function of pressure which are shown in
Figures 7 and 8, confirm that the rigid model for two-phase flow, in which the
liquid phase is incompressible, presents a mass flow less than the minimum
required for the applicability of homogenous flow assumption, namely 2000 kg/(m<sup>2</sup>.s).
For this reason the model of Hadj-Taieb [4] is not perfectly suited for the
simulation of our aforementioned homogeneous flow case. This is because the
mass flux at the entrance is, G = <img
width=21 height=17 src="002_files/image018.gif"> = 102.5 kg/(m<sup>2</sup>s),
which is considerably lower that the aforementioned lower limit of mass flux
2000 kg/(m<sup>2</sup>s) for the suitability of homogeneous flow model. We may emphasize
that the rigid model simulation in the case [4] might be adequate at higher

<p class="body">We now examine the
question about the effects of the initial pressure p<sub>e</sub>, and the flow
quality. Figure 9 shows the effect of u<sub>e</sub>, which is manifested by an
increase in the maximum of the velocity profiles mainly at low pressures.
Furthermore, by increasing the value of the flow quality &#952;, the velocity increases and
reaches 80 m/s, at &#952; = 0.0314.</p>

<p class="body">Reducing the
initial pressure from p<sub>e</sub> = 263000 Pa to 105000 Pa, we can see in
Figure 10 that the profiles &#961;(p) are approximately similar to those shown
earlier in Figure 7. Clearly, the change in p<sub>e</sub> leads to some
differences which appear when comparing the profiles of u(p) shown in Figures 8
and 11.</p>

<p class="body">However,
analysis of both Figures 10 and 11 alone shows that the conditions for applying
the homogeneous model are not ideally satisfied, because the mass flux G
remains lower than 2000 kg/(m<sup>2</sup>.s).</p>

<p class="body">A similar
observation can be made when the pressure at the pipe inlet is increased to p<sub>e</sub>
= 550000 Pa, in which case the density remains unchanged while the fluid
velocity increases, particularly when the flow quality is high, &#952; = 0.0314. We can see this on
Figures 12 and 13. However, the condition proposed by [14] remains unsatisfied
because we still have G = <img width=21 height=17
src="002_files/image018.gif"> &lt; 2000 kg/(m<sup>2</sup>s).</p>

<h4>5. Conclusions</h4>

<p class="body">In this study
we applied the method of characteristics (MOC) to the analysis of homogeneous
two-phase flow in pipes. We compared the predictions of the MOC method with
experimental data and the predictions of some other methods. We observed that
the simulation of two-phase flow for the cases of rigid and quasi-rigid models
with MOC gives better results than those predicted by the finite difference
scheme of Lax Wendroff. We also examined the effect of inlet velocity (u<sub>e</sub>)<sub>
</sub>and pressure (p<sub>e</sub>), as well as the flow quality, and showed
that the impact of these three factors is still unable to overcome the problems
of the inapplicability of the homogeneous mixture model as long as the mixture
mass flux remains below the well-accepted value of 2000 kg/(m<sup>2</sup>s).</p>
