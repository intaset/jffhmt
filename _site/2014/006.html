<p align="justify"><i><strong>Abstract- </strong>
In this study,
numerical analysis was used to investigate the effect of different parameters
on thermal efficiency of flat plate solar collectors. Various geometries were
examined in order to assess the influence of geometrical characteristics and
operating conditions on thermal efficiency of solar collectors. Important
parameters such as absorber thickness, riser position, shape of tube cross
section, absorber material, absorber absorptivity, glass transmissivity, and
mass flow rate have been investigated. Results show that the efficiency of
collector with risers on top of the absorber plate is 4.2% more than that of
the collector with risers on bottom. Also the tube cross-sectional geometry
shows strong effect on the efficiency e.g. the efficiency of collectors with
circular tubes is 38.4% more than that of collectors with triangular cross
sections. Thermal efficiency of solar collectors increases with increasing the
fluid flow rate, plate absorptivity, absorber thickness, and glass
transmissivity.</i></p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2> 

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Interest in solar energy has been growing in recent years and is
considered one of the main promising alternative sources of energy to replace
the fossil energy resources [1-2]. Solar water heating systems
are one of the major applications of solar energy and can
be used for various purposes, such as heating in apartments, family houses,
schools, agricultural farms, hospitals, restaurants and different industries.
Solar water heating systems, in some cases, can decrease indoor water heating
costs within 70% [3].</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In a solar collector, the solar energy is
transferred to a fluid medium. The most common and popular kind of solar
collectors is flat plate type. Flat plate solar collectors are more simple,
reliable and with relatively low price than the other types of collectors [4]. Gunnewiek
et al. [5-6] investigated flow distribution in unglazed transpired plate
collectors using TASC Flow-CFD code. It is shown that the air flow through the
collector surface is non-uniform due to the buoyancy effects.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Numerical models based on CFD models were presented
by Gadi [7]. In that work, the CFD transient predictions were verified using
indoor testing employing a solar simulator.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Experimental
and numerical studies of heat transfer in an integrated collector storage solar
water heater (ICSSWH) were performed by Gertzos et al. [8]. In their investigation a 3-D (CFD) model was
defined and validated with experimental results taken by a
Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) system.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Flow distribution and temperature profile through a
solar collector under different operating conditions was investigated by Fan et
al. [9]. Effects of some important parameters such as properties of working
fluid, flow rate, inlet temperature and collector tilt angle on the solar
collector performance were studied. They found that the flow distribution
through the absorber tubes is uniform under high mass flow rates. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">A numerical study for investigation of a flat plate solar energy collector was reported by Selmi et al. [3]. CFD-ACE software was employed to solve the equations of fluid flow, heat
transfer and radiation. The results showed that the predicted temperature profile has the same trend as
that of the experimental one. Good agreement between the CFD results and experimental data indicated that
the CFD is a valuable tool to predict the performance of the solar collectors.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">A novel polymer solar collector was investigated by Martinopoulos et al. [10]. In their study the effects of operating parameters on the velocity and
temperature profiles, solar irradiation, and heat transfer in the
circulating fluid through the collector were investigated using CFD analysis. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Al-Ansary and Zeitoun [11] investigated the
parabolic trough collectors using CFD simulation. Numerical modeling was used for
calculation of conduction and convection heat losses from the receiver of the
collector. Effect of insulating of solar collector on the heat loss was studied
and the numerical results showed that the insulation can reduce the overall
heat loss significantly.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Sultana et al. [12] investigated the thermal
performance of a solar micro-concentrating collector by optimizing of design to
maximize the overall thermal efficiency. Commercial CFD software,
ANSYS-CFX, was used to predict heat loss mechanisms, radiation, and convection
heat transfer inside the collector.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Akhtar and Mullick [13] developed numerical methods
for investigation of thermal performance of single and double-glazed solar
collectors. The effects of
absorption of solar radiation on convective and radiative heat transfer
coefficients were studied and the inner and outer surface temperatures of the
glass covers were calculated.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Experimental and numerical studies were performed by Dovic and Andrassy [14] in order to improve the thermal efficiency of the solar plate
collectors. Effects of
geometrical and operating parameters on thermal efficiency of solar collectors
were investigated and the results showed that no noticeable increase of efficiency could be achieved by changing the
distance between absorber and glazing.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Based on the
results on the available literature, there is a lack of information on the
effect of various operating and geometrical parameters on the overall
performance of solar collector. Therefore, it was decided to perform a
comprehensive numerical study on a flat plate solar collector and investigate
on improvement of thermal efficiency. The aim of this work is to study the effect of operating and design
parameters on the efficiency of flat plate solar collectors using control
volume based numerical method. Effects of geometrical and radiation characteristics of absorber, tubes,
and glass cover were considered. The commercial ANSYS FLUENT software was used
to solve numerically the fluid flow, heat transfer, and radiation equations.
Results were validated with the experimental data reported by Cruz-Peragon et al. [15].</p>

<h2>2. Theoretical Basis</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Forced convection heat transfer is encountered on
the front surface of flat plate solar collector; also wind induced heat losses
have a significant effect on the efficiency of solar collectors [16].</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The performance of a flat plate solar collector is
influenced by the thermal losses from the absorber to the ambient via the glass
covers [17-18]. For investigation of thermal performance of a solar collector, the equations
of fluid flow, heat transfer, and radiation should be considered.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The laminar, incompressible, three dimensional and
steady constant-properties viscous Newtonian flow inside a solar collector is
governed by the usual continuity, momentum and energy equations. For the above
assumptions, the continuity equation may be written as:</p>

<div class="eqn">
<img src="006_files/image013.png" class="img">
</div>
<div class="eqn-number">(1)</div>
<br>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">he momentum equations in x, y and z directions can
be written as:</p>

<div class="eqn">
<img src="006_files/image014.png" class="img">
</div>
<div class="eqn-number">(2)</div>
<br>

<div class="eqn">
<img src="006_files/image015.png" class="img">
</div>
<div class="eqn-number">(3)</div>
<br>

<div class="eqn">
<img src="006_files/image016.png" class="img">
</div>
<div class="eqn-number">(4)</div>
<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The energy equations for fluid and the frame of
collector are as following:</p>

<div class="eqn">
<img src="006_files/image017.png" class="img">
</div>
<div class="eqn-number">(5)</div>
<br>

<div class="eqn">
<img src="006_files/image018.png" class="img">
</div>
<div class="eqn-number">(6)</div>
<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The discrete ordinate (DO) model activated for
radiation model of heat transfer between the absorber, glass and casing walls.
DO model solves the radiative transport equation (RTE) for a finite number of
directions <img src="006_files/image006.png">. RTE of an
absorbing, emitting and scattering medium can be written for the arbitrary
position <img src="006_files/image005.png"> in a domain in the direction <img src="006_files/image006.png">. Eq. (7)
shows the radiative transfer equation (RTE) for an absorbing, emitting, and
scattering medium in DO model.</p>

<div class="eqn">
<img src="006_files/image021.png" class="img">
</div>
<div class="eqn-number">(7)</div>
<br>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Among other radiation models available in Fluent
[19], the DO model was shown to be the most comprehensive, allowing modeling at
various wave lengths and optical lengths, with moderate demands on CPU and
memory as well as with a moderate computational time.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The instantaneous collector efficiency relates the
useful energy to the total radiation incident on the collector surface by:</p>

<div class="eqn">
<img src="006_files/image022.png" class="img">
</div>
<div class="eqn-number">(8)</div>
<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The performance relation, Eq. (8), assumes that the
sun is perpendicular to the absorber plate of the collector, which infrequently
occurs.</p>

<h2>3. Numerical
investigations</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">3-D numerical investigations of the solar flat
plate collectors were performed by CFD technique and the governing equations
were solved using the commercial ANSYS FLUENT software version 14.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In this case, the models of mixed radiation heat transfer and convection
between the glass cover and side walls with surrounding, conduction heat
transfer in glass cover, insulating base of the collector and conduction
between the absorber plate and tubes were considered. The absorbed solar energy was simulated by setting
the value of direct solar irradiance to 800 W/m<sup>2</sup> that uniformly
distributed over the absorber plate. </p>


<h4>3.1. Computational Domain</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Steady state simulations are carried out with a 2 m<sup>2</sup>
flat plate solar collector panel. The geometrical dimensions are shown in Table
1.</p>

</table>
</div>
<br>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Due to the large difference in the dimension of
absorber tube length (2 m) and tube hydraulic diameter (0.0125 m), a very fine
grid distribution is needed in the cross-section of the tube. Therefore, some
assumptions on computational domain were carried out as follow:</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:7pt;">- Radiation loss from margins of collector was
neglected.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:7pt;">- Flow rate in all riser tubes is constant and
fluid is divided equally in all risers in collector.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:7pt;">- The heat loss from bottom surface of collector
was ignored </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:7pt;">- Since the flow field is symmetric with respect to
y-z plane, only one half of the riser tube and absorber plate has been
considered for simulation.</p>

<p align="justify">The computational domain is shown in Fig. 1.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Eight
different numbers of computational grids were tested and the temperature
differences between inlet and outlet
were obtained. The results are presented in
Fig.3. It is observed that a
further refinement of grids from 150000 to 450000 did not have a significant
effect on the temperature differences. Therefore, the grid generation with 150000 grids was considered as a computational domain.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:7pt;">1-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the inlet, the "velocity inlet" was used and the mass flow rate of
the fluid was specified. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:7pt;">2-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At outlet, the &quot;outflow&quot; condition was
applied.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:7pt;">3-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Symmetry&quot; condition was assumed on the
wall in middle of riser tube </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:7pt;">4-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the walls, no-slip boundary condition was imposed. The &quot;shell conduction&quot; option was enabled
for absorber and riser tube to compute heat conduction within the wall. The
&quot;semi-transparent&quot; option was enabled for glass cover to transmit
radiation into the collector area and the &quot;opaque&quot; option was enabled
for other surfaces.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The governing
equations were solved using the finite volume technique. Steady pressure based solver was used with second
order upwind scheme for convective terms in the momentum and energy equations.
For pressure discretization, the standard scheme was employed while the SIMPLE
algorithm was used for pressure-velocity coupling discretization.</p>





<h2>4. Results
and Discussion</h2>

<h4>4.1. Validation of the CFD Model</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Numerical results were verified with the
experimental data reported by Cruz-Peragon et al. [15]. For this case, the
solar collector involves 15 riser tubes. Solar incident radiation is 936.8 W/m<sup>2</sup>.
Water flow rate, water inlet temperature, and ambient temperature are 6.42
kg/hr,31&#730;C and 23.2 &#730;C respectively. Thickness of the absorber and
glass cover are 2mm and 4mm respectively. Inner diameter of risers is 10 mm and
distance between risers is 30 mm with 450 mm of riser's length. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Based on flow distribution in the risers given in
Cruz-Peragon et al. [15], the flow rate percentage in the riser 1 is 4.65%. So
the riser 1 was considered and the average fluid temperature was obtained in
four sections through the system. Fig. 4 shows the comparison between the
experimental data and the present numerical predictions.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The numerical results of the present investigation
show a good agreement with the experimental data, indicating the accuracy of the
numerical model. The average relative error between the experimental data and
numerical results is about 5.5%.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">A sample of temperature distribution and velocity
vectors in a 2-D cut of simulated collector are shown in Figs. 5. </p>

</figure>
<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Fig. 5 (a) shows the heat transfers from absorber
to riser tube by conduction and convection mechanisms. It can be found from
Fig. 5 (b) that the natural convection is created around the riser due to the
air flow in a gap of 25 mm. Similar behavior is reported by Subiantoro and Ooi
[4].</p>

<h4>4.2. Effect of Riser Position on the Thermal Efficiency</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In order to investigate the influence of riser
position, various models with different positions of risers related to the
absorber were investigated. In models (a, b), the riser tube is attached to the
top surface of the absorber plate, in model (c) the riser is located in middle
of absorber, in models (d, e) the riser is attached to the bottom surface of
the absorber. Fig.6 shows the schematic diagram of the risers.</p>

<figure>
<img src="006_files/image028.png" class="img"/>

<figcaption>
Figure 6. Various positions of riser and absorber- (1) absorber plate - (2) riser tube</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">These five configurations were simulated under
constant Reynolds number, inlet fluid temperature, and solar radiation. Fig. 7
shows the thermal performance of the various models.</p>

<figure>
<img src="006_files/image029.png" class="img"/>

<figcaption>
Figure 7. Efficiency of collector with different riser's position</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Numerical results show
that by changing riser's position from top to bottom surface of the absorber
plate, the efficiency of the collector decreases. The collector with risers on
top of the absorber plate (model a) is 4.2% more efficient than collector with
risers on bottom of the absorber plate (model e) because for configuration (a)
more collectors surface is available for heat transfer.</p>

<h4>4.3. Effect of Riser Shape on the Thermal Efficiency</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">For investigation on the effect of noncircular
riser tubes on the heat transfer in flat plate solar collectors, four models
with different riser shapes were purposed. The collectors with triangular,
square, hexagonal and circular shape riser tubes were considered as shown in
Fig.8.</p>

<figure>
<img src="006_files/image030.png" class="img"/>

<figcaption>
Figure 8. Non-circular risers</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The efficiency of collector with circular and
noncircular riser tubes was studied and results are presented in Fig.9. These simulations were performed under the 0.02 kg/s of fluid mass flow
rate. </p>

<figure>
<img src="006_files/image031.png" class="img"/>

<figcaption>
Figure 9. Efficiency of collector with circular and non-circular riser tube</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Fig.9 shows that collector with circular riser tube
(model c) is the most efficient collector type. In fact by increasing the
cross-sectional sharp corners the collector efficiency decreases. This is due
to the fact that convection heat transfer is very weak for the channels with
sharp corners. The collectors with circular riser tubes, have 38.4%, 11.2%, and
6.6% more efficiency than those of the collectors with triangular, square, and
hexagonal riser tubes, respectively. </p>



<h4>4.4. Effect of Mass Flow Rate on Thermal Efficiency</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">To investigate on flow rate effects, model (a) was considered with flow
rate of 0.02-0.05 kg/s. Fig.10 presents the variations of collector efficiency
versus the reduced temperature parameters, (Ti-Ta)/G, for different mass flow
rates. As shown in Fig. 10 by increasing the fluid flow rate from 0.02 to 0.05 kg/s,
the collector efficiency increases by 8.2%. Also it can be found that
increasing reduced temperature parameter from 0.0025 to 0.0075 yielded 6%
decrease of the efficiency and this trend was already reported by Yousefi et
al. [20].</p>

<br>

<h4>4.5. Effect of Absorber Thickness on the Thermal Efficiency</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Effect of absorber thickness on collector efficiency was studied and the
results are shown in Fig.11. The simulations were performed for 0.05 kg/s of
mass flow rate and 0.0025 of reduced temperature parameter. Based on the
results, the collector efficiency increases by increasing the absorber
thickness, e.g. by increasing the thickness from 0.1mm to 0.6 mm, the
efficiency increases up to 15%, which is due to the lower heat transfer
resistance for the absorber with higher thickness.</p>

<figure>
<img src="006_files/image033.png" class="img"/>

</figure>
<br>

<h4>4.6. Effect of Absorber Material on Thermal Efficiency</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">One of the most important sections in a solar flat
plate collector is absorber plate, which absorbs the solar radiation and
transfers heat to the risers and fluid medium. Therefore, the material
properties of absorber plate play an important role in conduction heat transfer
from the absorber to the riser tubes. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Within this study, different absorber plates of
copper, aluminum and steel with various thermal conductivities were used and
results are demonstrated in Fig.12. As shown in this figure, by increasing the
absorber conductivity, the collector efficiency increases.</p>

<figure>
<img src="006_files/image034.png" class="img"/>

<figcaption>
Figure 12. Collector efficiency of various absorber materials</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Efficiency of copper absorber is 3.4% and 35%
higher than those of the aluminum and steel absorber plates respectively.</p>

<h2>4.7. Effect of Absorber Absorptivity and Glass Cover Transmissivity on
Thermal Efficiency</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In order to examine the effect of absorber
absorptivity, collectors with different absorptivity were considered and the
calculated results are shown in Fig.13. Results indicate that by increasing the
absorber absorptivity, the collector efficiency increases linearly. By
increasing the absorptivity from 0.8 to 0.98, the collector efficiency
increases up to 4.2%.</p>

<figure>
<img src="006_files/image035.png" class="img"/>

<figcaption>
Figure 13. Collector efficiency of various absorber absorptivities</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Glass cover transmissivity is an important parameter affecting collector
efficiency. In the present investigation simulations were carried out with
different glass transmissivities and the results are presented in Fig.14. The
results indicate that as the transmissivity increases the radiation to inside
area of collector enhances, which results in better heat transfer performance
of the solar collector. For instance by increasing the transmissivity from 0.82
to 0.96, the collector efficiency increases by 16.9%.</p>

<h2>5. Conclusion</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">A 3-D numerical simulation was carried out to
investigate about the efficiency of a flat plate solar collector. Various geometries and operating conditions were examined in order to assess
the influence of riser position, shape of tube area section, mass flow rate,
absorber thickness, absorber material, absorber absorptivity, and glass
transmissivity on thermal efficiency of solar collectors. The
commercial ANSYS FLUENT software was used to solve numerically fluid flow, heat
transfer, and radiation equations. Results were verified through the comparison with the available
experimental data in the literature.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The results showed that the collector with risers
on top of the absorber plate is 4.2% more efficient than collector with risers
on bottom of the absorber plate. Also the collectors with circular riser tubes
have more efficiency than those of the collectors with non-circular cross
sectional tubes. In addition, thermal efficiency of
solar collectors increases with increasing the absorber conductivity, fluid flow
rate, plate absorptivity, absorber thickness, and glass transmissivity.</p>
