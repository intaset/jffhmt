    <p class="body"><b>Abstract</b> - <i>Automobile air-conditioning systems are not very efficient even for use in conjunction with internal combustion engines. This problem is more critical if they are to be used in electric vehicles because conventional systems consume a significantly more energy and therefore tremendously shortens the travel distance per charge of an electric vehicle. Besides the development of new generation air-conditioning system, one of the easier remedies is to reduce the heating effects of a cabin so that the requirement for air-conditioning can be minimized and thus its energy consumption by the system. Current work aims to identify some of the key factors that may help minimize the cooling load of an electrical vehicle. This work investigates the solar radiation effect on a 5:1 reduced scale car cabin, whose dimensions were based on the actual dimension of a Formosa Martiz. In the process of radiative heating, the temperatures in the cabin were found increase at a much higher rate in the beginning. On the other hand, the installation of window film and sun screen effectively reduced the rise in cabin temperature. Hence, their installation will significantly help saving the overall car energy and therefore extend an electric car travel distance per charge. The color of the cabin external surfaces should be carefully chosen so that these surfaces can effectively reflect the radiative heat energy. Also, the cabin ceiling should be insulated as much as possible to reduce the amount of heat conduction into the cabin space.</i></p>

<h4>1. Introduction</h4> 

<p class="body">In general, a reliable car
is expected to be driven for at least 300 miles (482 km) before another easy
and quick refueling. Not only so, the vehicle has to be capable of keeping up
with the flow of traffic. Since their first debut in the 18 century, all
gasoline cars have been improved and have become an asset every modern family
must own. Unfortunately, the extensive use of these vehicles has brought forth
a tremendous change in lifestyle to the world population in terms of both
convenience and tragedy. Despite the mobility the gasoline vehicles offers
their users, their smoke and pollutant emission have greatly polluted the
environment and is believed to be one of the culprits leading to recent
dramatic change in climate. To remedy this, the use of fossil fuel has to be
minimized if not entirely eliminated. </p>

<p class="body">For this reason, electric
cars have lately been given a lot of attention because they, unlike gasoline
cars, produce almost no pollution. Unfortunately, an average electric car can
only travel up to 100 miles (161 km) on a single electric charge. Even
so, it has been reported that Toyota RAV4 EV can travel at most 125 miles per
charge. In 2008, Simon Hackett and Emilis Prelgauskas even drove a Tesla
Roadster and had completed 313 miles (501 km) on a single charge in the 10th
annual Global Green Challenge. This achievement has set a new record for the
production of electric vehicle [1]. </p>

<p class="body">Since the automobile
air-conditioning system consumes a lot of power, the activation of automobile
air-conditioning system in any electric vehicle can greatly jeopardize the mileage
per charge of the electric car [2]. Regardless
of how soon a highly efficient air-conditioning system is developed for the
electrical vehicle, it is always a good practice to minimize the dependence of
the electric car users on air-conditioning system. When there is less need
for air-conditioning system, a better mileage per charge for the
electric vehicle can be achieved. </p>

<p class="body">Fujita et. al. [3] have
developed a numerical simulation to predict the thermal environment of a
simplified car cabin model under different air-conditioning conditions. Their
analysis took into consideration of the effect of solar thermal irradiation,
the heat conduction among the car materials, the ventilation inside the
instrument panel, and the air leaks that take place through the gaps of the
interior parts. At the same year, Kataoka and Nakamura [4] have investigated
the variation of cabin air temperature under prescribed cooling cycle condition
and solar thermal irradiation on the wall to consider the transient and actual
driving conditions. Through experimental means, Martinho et al. [5] have studied
the thermal comfort in a multi- purpose vehicle (MPV) cabin through the
equivalent temperature index. On the other hand, Song et. al. [6] have introduced the
mathematical model of air flow in cabin dealing with complex boundary condition as well as the
computational domains corresponding to the air and solid component of
the car.
</p>

<p class="body">Rosendahl and Olesen [7] have
presented the different results about the thermal environment inside a vehicle
for different air temperatures, operative temperatures, and equivalent
temperatures. The tests were carried out in the winter season during the
heat-up process of the car cabin. Based on the measurements, the time used to
reach the level of thermal comfort was evaluated. Kilic and Sevilgen [8]
have collected the velocity and temperature measurements in a car cabin during
a heating period. At the same time, Korukcu and Kilic [9] have used an infrared
thermal camera to determine the variation of the instantaneous temperature
distributions of all surfaces inside a car cabin and to identify the sources of
thermal discomfort. Yang et al. [10] have built a transparent acrylic car cabin
model almost half the size of a real car. They have measured the airflow
characteristics at 18 different regions in a car cabin using the PIV technique.
In conjunction with climatic data collected in Athens, GA from April through
August 2007, Grundstein et al. [11] reported that the average
highest cabin temperatures on clear days were 68&deg;C in the summer and 61&deg;C in
the spring, but were on average approximately 10&deg;C cooler on cloudy days during
the spring and summer.</p>

<p class="body">Zhu et al. [12] have numerically and
experimentally examined the environmental conditions in public transportation
buses. Their CFD model was used to calculate the distributions of the mean age
and mean residual lifetime of air and to evaluate the ventilation system
efficiency. Their work also experimentally collected and analyzed the indoor
environmental quality in a Harvard University shuttle bus. At the same
year, Al-Kayiem et al. [13] have published their experimental and numerical results.
Their subject was a salon car parked in an open space exposed to the direct
sun. The six scenario investigated include a full windows closing case, four
different windows opening settings and sun shade usage case. The temperatures
at 12 different locations inside the car have been recorded for many days. They
concluded that the use of sunshade and/or dropdown side windows effectively
reduce the heat accumulation within the cabin. Most recently, Kamar et
al. [14] have measured the cabin temperatures under road test using T-type
thermocouples to validate their prediction of automotive air-conditioning
system performance. Sevilgen and Kilic [15] performed a 3D numerical analysis
of steady-state and transient temperature distribution in the car cabin. Their
computational results were compared to and validated by experimental measurements.</p>

<p class="body">Since the usage of
conventional automobile air-conditioning systems are highly inefficient for electric
vehicles, the authors deeply feel that, while new generation vehicle air-conditioning system may take
a much longer time to develop, a quick and simple yet practical approach is to
reduce the total amount heat entering the cabin of an electric vehicle. This
motivates current work whose objective is to study the increase in cabin
temperature under the influence of prolonged solar irradiation. Understanding how these important factors influence the cabin
temperature will be beneficial in improving electric car mileage per charge
through passive thermal design and daily practice of electric vehicle users.</p>



<h4>2. Experiment</h4>

<p class="subhead">2.1. Car Cabin Model</p>

<p class="body">A 5:1 reduced scale experimental
cabin model has been built based on the actual measurement of a Formosa Martiz.
For simplicity, the front and rear compartments of the car model have been
neglected. However, the dashboard and four seats have been included for
the completion of investigation. Fig. 1 shows the actual model after assembly. </p>

<figure>
<img src="008_files/image001.jpg" class="article-img">

<figcaption>
Figure 1. Car cabin model</figcaption>
</figure>


<p class="body">The model has a dimension
of 50 cm (length) x 24.4 cm (width) x 14.4 cm (height). The projection height
of the glass is 9 cm. The front and rear tilted angles are 35&deg; and 45&deg;,
respectively. The glass composing the side windows were accurately calculated
through Solidworks, a 3D CAD design software. These four pieces of glasses were
adhered to each other with Silicone adhesive. The interior of the cabin
model consists of a dashboard and four seats. The dashboard and side panels
were all made of wood because it has been reported that the heat exchange
between the car body and the car interior was very limited according to
unpublished experimental data [16]. For this same reason, the engine and rear compartments
of the model were neglected as well. The arrangement of these accessories is
shown in Fig. 2.</p>

<p class="subhead">2.2. Data Acquisition System</p>

<p class="body">Other than the environment
temperature, the temperature variations at 19 locations in the cabin have been
traced and recorded using K-Type thermocouples and a data logger (FLUKE 2640A).</p>

<p class="body">This data logger is
capable of simultaneously recording 20 temperature readings through its
channels. Its temperature readings have a precision of 0.1&deg;C. Some of these
locations where thermocouples are attached include the cabin ceiling, the
dashboard, the front and rear windscreens, the side window, the front and
backseats, the front and rear legrooms, the center of the cabin space, etc.</p>



<p class="subhead">2.3. Apparatus Arrangement</p>

<p class="body">To simulate the solar
thermal irradiation, a 350W infrared light source was used. It was fixed at a
given distance <i>d</i> away from the cabin model illuminating at a given elevation angle &#61553;. This angle is
measured from a horizontal planar datum, as shown in Fig. 3. </p>

<p class="body">The same figure also displays
the experimental setup of current work. This experiment as performed in a dark room
so that the effect of ambient thermal irradiation can be minimized. Fig. 4
shows a snapshot of current experiment.</p>

<p class="body">The simulated solar flux <i>q</i>
in this experiment can be estimated as</p>

<div class="equation">
<img src="008_files/image005.png" class="eqn">
<div class="eqn-number">(1)</div>
</div>


<p class="body">where <i>h</i> is the
efficiency of the infrared light bulb (which normally varies between 0.90 and
0.95), <i>P</i> is the power of the light source, and <i>d</i> is the distance
between the light source and the car cabin. As a matter of fact, the exact
value of <i>d</i> should vary from point to point depending on where the light
hits the surface of the car cabin. In general, this distance was fixed at 30 cm
in current work. Based on the above values, the simulated solar flux <i>q</i>
was roughly 278 W/m<sup>2</sup>. Since the distance between the light source
and the car model was control within 0.5 cm, the error of the simular solar
flux was 9 W/m<sup>2</sup>. Since the car cabin in this work is a
reduced model by 5:1, the solar flux employed here is equivalent to a solar
flux of approximately (1390&plusmn;45) W/m<sup>2</sup>. This value is comparable to a
sunny condition where the solar flux is about 1357 W/m<sup>2</sup> [17].</p>



<h4>3. Results and Discussions</h4>

<p class="subhead">3.1. Effects of Irradiation Shielding</p>

<p class="subhead"><i>3.1.1. Tinted Glass</i></p>

<p class="body">Figs. 5 compare the
temperature variation at different locations associated to the car cabin model.
The blue and red lines correspond to the case whose glasses are tinted or not
by window film installation, respectively. </p>


<figure>
<img src="008_files/image006.jpg" class="article-img">

<figcaption>
Figure 5. Temperatures for cabin with and without tinted glass: (a) front windscreen; (b) dashboard; (c) front seat bottom; and (d) front seat back</figcaption>
</figure>


<p class="body">It was found that except
for the front windscreen (as in Fig. 5(a)), the increase in temperature inside
the cabin could be significantly reduced if the glasses were tinted. However,
it can be discovered that the temperature at the front windscreen increased
sharply within 20 minutes after the beginning of radiative heating process.
After approximately 1 hour, temperature increased at a much slower rate
continuously. At the dashboard, the rate of temperature increase was apparently
different right at the beginning of the heating process, as shown in Fig. 5(b).
After approximately 1 hour, the rate of temperature became constant. The drop
in temperature variation during the heating process was the most significant at
the front seat bottom. In this study, the seats were made of wood but
completely covered by a layer of black synthetic leather. In this case, although
the ray from the infrared light source was directed towards the front seat back,
the light was partially blocked by the ceiling causing the temperature of the
front seat bottom to be much higher than that of the front seat back. Because
of the tinted glass, the front seat bottom temperature dropped tremendously. As
shown in Fig. 5(d), the temperature on the front seat back surface demonstrated
a trend very similar to that on the dashboard. This phenomenon is very much
different from that at the front seat bottom because the infrared beam had not
directly shined on the front seat back.</p>

<p class="body">Combining all the
temperature variation in Fig. 5, if the glass was not tinted, the temperature
at the front seat bottom was consistently the highest, followed by the front
windscreen, the dashboard, and the front seat back. This finding contradicts to
the fact reported in the literature, which indicates that the temperature of
the dashboard is the highest. It is remarkable to point out that the dashboard
in this study was purposely made of wood. This study proves that the raise in
actual dashboard temperature is in a great extent related to the dashboard
material. If the glass was tinted, the temperature on the front windscreen
remained the highest followed by the dashboard, the front seat bottom, and the
front seat back.</p>

<p class="body">Also discovered is that
the window film installation made the greatest difference in the beginning of
the heating process because the rate of heat accumulation within the cabin was
greatly reduced in the first hour. After a certain period of time, the rates of
temperature increased with and without the installation of window film appeared
to be the same.</p>

<p class="subhead"><i>3.1.2. Others</i></p>

<p class="body">The effects of the
installation of either window film or sun screen are compared and shown in Fig.
6. </p>

<figure>
<img src="008_files/image007.png" class="article-img">

<figcaption>
Figure 6. Effect of solar irradiation shielding devices on the cabin temperature variation</figcaption>
</figure>


<p class="body">It shows the temperatures
at 5 locations in the cabin under a consistent radiative heating through the
infrared light source for 2 hours. Apparently, in a cabin with clear glass, the
temperature on the front seat bottom was the highest while that at the front
legroom was the lowest. Obviously, the installation of these devices effectively
helps keeping the cabin cooler. Between these two devices, the effect of using
sun screen obviously seems to overcome that of using window film except at the
front windscreen. The temperature at the windscreen demonstrates a completely
opposite trend under the effect of these devices. As a matter of fact, the
front windscreen is the hottest among the three scenarios. In this work, the
window film was pasted on the glass while the sun screen was placed inside the
cabin immediately below the front windscreen. Since the temperatures in the
cabin were the coolest when sun screen was installed, the placement of the sun
screen had no doubt blocked the radiative heat from entering the cabin. However,
the sun screen reflected the heat back to the front windscreen at the same time
and eventually providing more heat to the front windscreen. Hence, the
placement of the sun screen beneath the front windscreen caused a two stage
heating process on the front windscreen.</p>

<p class="subhead">3.2. Effects of Sun Position</p>

<p class="subhead"><i>3.2.1 Elevation Angle</i></p>

<p class="body">Fig. 7 proves that the
solar elevation angle has a crucial influence on the temperature variations
within the cabin. </p>

<figure>
<img src="008_files/image008.png" class="article-img">

<figcaption>
Figure 7. Effect of solar elevation angle on the cabin temperature variation</figcaption>
</figure>


<p class="body">In this case, the car was
assumed to park in such a way that its windscreen was perfectly aligned in the
direction facing the sun. At relatively small sun elevation angles (i.e., <i>q</i> &#8804; 30&deg;),
solar thermal radiation penetrated the front windscreen and reached the front
facing surfaces, such as the dashboard, the front seat bottom, and the front
seat back. Among them, the highest temperature was found on the front seat
back. This is because this almost vertical surface was at an orientation which
was associated to the greatest value for view factor over other surface
orientations. As the solar elevation angle continued to increase (i.e., <i>q</i> = 45&deg;), the
temperature readings on almost all the surfaces increased because the amount of
radiative heat reflected from the front windscreen decreased and therefore more
heat was transmitted through the front windscreen. It was found that the
increase in temperature was much greater at the front seat bottom than the
front seat back. When the solar elevation angle was further increased to 60&deg;,
the temperature on the front seat bottom increased accordingly. However, the
temperature on the front seat back actually dropped tremendously as it hided in
the shadow of the cabin ceiling. At large solar elevation angles (i.e., <i>&#61553;</i>
&#8805; 60&deg;), it follows that the temperatures at the dashboard and the front
seats dropped because the presence of the ceiling had blocked the solar
irradiation. Also, the ceiling temperature was higher at the front part than
the rear part. In fact, this phenomenon is not supposed to happen in actual
case because the infrared light source in current study is comparatively small.
Therefore, the infrared source is unable to provide a parallel beam of light. In
contrary, the irradiation from sun can be assumed parallel because not only
does the sun is much large in size than the Earth but also it is very far away
from us. On the other hand, the temperature at the front portion of the ceiling
remained unchanged while that at its rear portion increased continuously.</p>


<p class="subhead"><i>3.2.2. Car Orientation</i></p>

<p class="body">If the solar irradiation
shines upon the cabin from the side instead of the front, it is found that the
variation of temperature increase within the cabin space changed dramatically,
as clearly depicted in Fig. 8. </p>

windows</figcaption>
</figure>



<p class="body">As expected, the dashboard
and front seat temperatures increased the most when the car was facing the sun.
In contrast, the temperatures recorded on the surfaces at the rear portion of
the cabin were clearly among the lowest. Also discovered was that the front
side window was warmer than the rear side window. Again, this phenomenon is
less likely to happen in real situation because the irradiation from the sun is
generally parallel and thus provides relatively identical radiative heating
condition for both the front and rear side windows. Besides, the front seats
were consistently hotter than the rear seats for the same reason
aforementioned. However, if the infrared light source shined upon the car cabin
on the side, the temperatures at the front windscreen and front seat bottom
actually dropped significantly. At the same time, the temperatures at both the
front seat back and the entire backseat actually increased. Generally, the
amount of temperature increase on the cabin accessories was clearly greater
than the amount dropped particularly at the dashboard and the front seat
bottom. This implies that there was an increase amount of heat radiated into
the cabin simply because of the increase in window glass area that allowed more
thermal radiation to enter the cabin.</p>


<p class="subhead">3.3. Effects of Exterior
Color</p>

<p class="body">The color of the car cabin
exterior was also investigated in this work. The external surface of the cabin
model was painted in either metallic blue or metallic silver. The light source
was placed in a way such that the radiative heat from the light entered the
cabin space through the side windows. The temperatures recorded at 7 different
locations after 4 hours of radiative heating are shown in Fig. 9. </p>

<figcaption>
Figure 9. Effect of solar elevation angle on the cabin temperature variation</figcaption>
</figure>


<p class="body">Because the light shined
from the side, the temperature at the dashboard was no longer the highest.
Instead, the temperature at the front seat bottom was greater than that at the
dashboard regardless of the color of the cabin exterior. When the cabin
exterior was painted with different colors, the temperature readings have provided
a strong evident that the cabin with silver exterior is cooler than the cabin
with blue exterior. This is because the solar reflectivities for silver and
slate blue surfaces are 0.60 and 0.27, respectively [21] and the silver exterior
is therefore
capable
of reflecting more radiative heat energy away from the cabin side panels and
therefore allowing less heat energy to enter the cabin space through heat
conduction mechanism. It was surprising to find that even the glasses portion
of the cabin benefit from replacing the blue exterior with silver exterior. This
finding somewhat suggests that, other than the solar irradiation, the
temperature differences within the cabin also contribute to the raise in
temperature for the accessories in the cabin. In other words, thermal convection
drives an effective mechanism for heat transport from the lower portion of the
cabin to the upper portion. Based on the observation obtained here, it is suggested
that the appropriate color of electric car should be chosen so that its thermal
reflectivity can be maintained at a high level. This will evidently improve the
thermal comfort in the electric car cabin.</p>



<p class="subhead">3.4. Effects of Roof Materials</p>

<p class="body">The effect of the thermal properties
of the car body has also been investigated, particularly the roof of the car
cabin. The roofs of the cabin model were made of either a steel plate or a
wooden plate. The thermal diffusivity of stainless steel is about 3.4x10<sup>-6</sup>
m<sup>2</sup>/s to 12x10<sup>-6</sup> m<sup>2</sup>/s depending on the grade of
the steel [18-19] while that of wood is roughly 0.161x10<sup>-6</sup> m<sup>2</sup>/s
[20]. This property signifies the ability of a material to conduct thermal
energy relative to its ability to store thermal energy. Clearly, the steel roof
transfers more heat into the cabin while the wood roof tends to store more heat
within the material. Not only do their thermal diffusivity different, their surface
properties directly related to thermal radiation are also apparently
distinctive and too complicated to quantify. On the other hand, the thermal
conductivity of stainless steel is about 16-24 W/mK while that of wood is
roughly 0.1-0.4 W/mK depending on the water content in the wood. The thicknesses
of the steel and wooden roofs are 1.2 mm and 6 mm, respectively. Therefore, the
thermal resistances for both the steel and wooden roofs are 5x10<sup>-5</sup>-7.5x10<sup>-5</sup>
m<sup>2</sup>K/W and 1.5x10<sup>-2</sup>-6x10<sup>-2</sup> m<sup>2</sup>K/W,
respectively. Based on these figures, it is found that the thermal resistance
of the wooden roof is at least 200 times greater than that of a steel roof. Fig.
10 shows the temperature of various locations in the cabin model after a 1.5-hour
radiative heating period. </p>


<figure>
<img src="008_files/image011.jpg" class="article-img">

<figcaption>
Figure 10. Effect of solar elevation angle on the cabin temperature variation</figcaption>
</figure>


<p class="body">Since the light source was
placed 30 cm away from the model and an elevation angle of 30&deg;. Based
on measurement, the temperatures at the steel and wooden roofs are 38.4&deg;C and
42.1&deg;C, respectively. Under this setting, the roof of the model absorbed a
great deal of the radiative heat energy from the light source. As a result,
the roof serves as another heat source transferring heat energy into the cabin
through heat conduction mode. Current experimental measurements suggested that
the cabin with a wooden roof was generally about 5&deg;C cooler than that with a
stainless steel roof despite the fact that the top surface of the wooden roof
is generally about 5&deg;C hotter than the stainless steel one. </p>



<h4>4. Conclusions </h4>

<p class="body">Based on the experimental
findings of this work, several important conclusions can be made to assist the
improvement of future electric car designs. These findings suggest that
electric car windows should at least be tinted whenever possible. Furthermore,
the external surface of the cabin should be painted appropriately to keep the
cabin interior temperature a few degrees Celsius lower. On the other hand, the
solar elevation angle plays an important role in the heating process of the car cabin.
The locations in the cabin absorbing the most thermal radiation depend on the
time of a day during the solar irradiative heating process. Not only so, because of its greater transparent
glass area, the irradiative thermal energy entering the cabin space through the side windows is greater than that through the front
windshield. Radiative heat from the sun would enter the cabin space through conduction via
the cabin roof. Current experimental results confirm that the cabin ceiling
insulation significantly helps reducing the overall cabin air temperature.</p>
