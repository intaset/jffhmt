    <p class="body"><b>Abstract</b> - <i>Transport phenomena in fractured porous media, which contribute to a considerable portion of the world oil recovery, is strongly affected by the interaction between fractures and the neighboring porous matrix blocks that may result in capillary continuity. Liquid bridges play a significant role in maintaining capillary continuity across porous blocks in fractured rocks. Capillary continuity created by liquid bridges is important in various fields such as oil recovery from naturally fractured oil reservoirs, water resources and environmental applications. In this paper, static liquid bridges are mathematically studied. A new dimensionless analysis of the Young-Laplace equation is developed, where the shape of the liquid bridge surface is characterized with two dimensionless parameters. Through this dimensionless scaling, under the absence of gravity, an integral describing the gas-liquid interface variation of a liquid bridge is obtained and evaluated numerically.

<h4>1. Introduction</h4> 
<p class="body">A good
understanding of transport phenomena in unsaturated fractured porous media is
the key to the successful description of a number of industrial processes such
as oil recovery from petroleum reservoirs [1-3], water resources and waste
disposal management [4,5], and wicking of liquids connected to porous materials
in printing or coating processes as well as cleaning applications [6,7]. For
instance, Ghezzehei and Or [4] developed a theoretical model for liquid
fragmentation along inclined fractures and then Or and Ghezzehei [5] applied
this model to study the potential for more rapid arrival times of pollutants
carried with discrete liquid elements along the inclined fractures compared to
continuum liquid film flow on both fracture walls. Also, Dejam and Hassanzadeh
[2] modeled capillary continuity between porous matrix blocks through formation
of liquid bridges. Capillary continuity created by the liquid bridges can
improve oil recovery from naturally fractured reservoirs substantially. Fracture
capillary pressure and a block-to-block interaction between matrix blocks can
significantly affect the transport of material from rock matrix blocks. The
effect of these two important phenomena has been a source of uncertainty in
predictions of oil recovery [8,9] and contaminant migration in subsurface
formations [4,5] and requires further investigation. The block-to-block
interaction between matrix blocks can be explained by the combination of two
different phenomena: capillary continuity between blocks and reinfiltration of
the drained liquid from upper to lower blocks. These processes cause drastic
changes in the fluid transport between the rock matrix blocks. The capillary
continuity phenomenon is an important contributor to oil drainage in fractured
reservoirs and contaminant migration in fractured aquifers. Capillary
continuity provides a strong communication between partially or completely
isolated rock matrix blocks, thus creating an enhanced transport of liquids by
gravity drainage [10]. The gravitational drainage efficiency of liquids from a
column of stacked rock blocks is dictated by the continuous height of the
liquid column [9]. In other words, capillary continuity increases the height of
the continuous liquid column in a vertical column of fractured rock and thereby
increases the recovery of oil.</p>

<p class="body">Capillary
continuity in vertically stacked matrix blocks has been studied extensively [9,11,12].
They investigated the properties of materials present in fractures and the
effects of the overburden pressure as well as the relative permeability on the
capillary continuity. Firoozabadi and Markeset [13] reported a series of
experimental results in which they varied the fracture aperture and degree of
contact between blocks. They observed that the formation and breakdown of
liquid droplets across open fractures was one of the mechanisms of desaturation
(i.e., a decrease of liquid saturation in the upper matrix block). Saidi [8]
attempted to specify the conditions for having stable liquid bridges across
fractures. He concluded that if the fracture aperture is about 50 &#956;m or more,
capillary continuity along a stack of matrix blocks cannot be realized. An
important aspect is the critical fracture aperture, which is defined as the
aperture below which liquid drops may form stable liquid bridges across the
fractures. A formula for the critical aperture was suggested by Sajjadian et
al. [14]. Aspenes et al. [1] experimentally showed that wetting phase bridges
stabilize capillary continuity across open fractures and increase oil recovery.
They discussed that the size of the bridges seems controlled by the wettability
of the rock and not by the differential pressure applied across the open
fractures.</p>

<p class="body">Dejam
et al. [15] studied the impact of fracture angle and aperture variations on a
re-infiltration process through discrete traveling liquid elements and
continuum film flow along inclined fractures between upper and lower porous
matrix blocks. Thereafter, Haugen et al. [16] experimentally showed that how
the fractures determine the oil displacement pattern differently depending on the
matrix wettability conditions during waterflood in fractured porous media.
Subsequently, Dejam and Hassanzadeh [2] studied the formation of liquid bridges
between porous matrix blocks. They coupled a liquid element elongation model
with various fracture capillary pressure models to study the liquid bridge
formation phenomenon. They concluded that a threshold Bond number plays a
significant role in the formation of liquid bridges between matrix blocks.
Later, Mashayekhizadeh et al. [17] observed the free gravity drainage mechanism
of oil at pore level using glass micromodels. They investigated the role of a fracture
aperture and tilt angle on the stability of liquid bridges and the shape of a
front during free gravity drainage process. Then, Zendehboudi and Chatsiz [18]
experimentally visualized the oil recovery during controlled gravity drainage
in a fractured porous medium through determination of the height difference
between gas-liquid interfaces in the matrix and fracture.</p>

<p class="body">Recently,
Mashayekhizadeh et al. [19] considered the stability of liquid bridges in
fractured porous media at the pore scale using a glass micromodel representing a stack of two
blocks at different tilt angles to monitor the frequency and stability of
liquid bridges formed during free-fall gravity drainage as a function of the tilt
angle. They observed that by increasing the tilt angle, the liquid bridge
frequency decreased but its stability increased and this resulted in higher
ultimate recovery. Furthermore, Haugen et al. [20] experimentally studied the effect
of the fractures on the oil recovery during foam injection in fractured media.
In addition, Zendehboudi et al. [21] performed experiments and numerical
simulations to investigate the effects of fracture properties, such as angle
and aperture, on the behavior of free-fall and controlled gravity drainage
processes. They concluded that the matrix-fracture interaction plays the most
significant role in the liquid drainage from the fractured media. Zendehboudi
et al. [21] showed that upon moderate inclination angles, enhanced recovery
performance is achieved in controlled gravity drainage process due to more
rapid liquid withdrawal. They also found that it is possible to develop an
isolated liquid phase above a horizontal fracture when the fracture aperture is
higher than the value required maintaining capillary continuity between matrix
blocks.</p>

<p class="body">A number of
theoretical studies have investigated static liquid bridges [22-35]. The
related studies in the literature are not limited to static liquid bridges. In
the past decades, the dynamic evolution of the gas-liquid interface and the
rupture of a liquid bridge have been the subject of numerous publications [36-40].
This article is focused on the shape of liquid bridges between rock matrix blocks
and addresses the liquid bridges formed between two parallel plates. In the
following section, an analysis of the Young-Laplace equation is presented. With
the aid of this analysis, the shape of a liquid bridge can be expressed in
terms of two dimensionless parameters.</p>

<p class="body">This paper is
structured as follows. First, a new dimensionless model is developed for the
shape variations of the liquid bridges between porous matrix blocks. Then the
results and discussions are presented, followed by the summary and conclusions.</p>

<h4>2. Mathematical Modeling</h4>

<p class="body">Fig. 1 shows a
liquid bridge in a horizontal fracture (with aperture <i>b</i>). As mentioned
earlier, it is assumed that the lower face of the upper block and the upper
face of the lower block are assumed to be flat and smooth; therefore, the
liquid bridge is assumed to be between two parallel plates. Furthermore, it is
assumed that the liquid bridge is at static conditions and the shape of the liquid
bridge does not vary with possible longitudinal flow from the upper to lower
blocks. In Fig. 1, <i>z </i>and <i>r</i> demonstrate polar coordinates where <i>z</i>
is measured along the symmetry axis and <i>r</i> is the distance perpendicular
to this axis. Moreover, it is assumed that the interface has axial symmetry in the
absence of gravity; therefore, its shape can be defined by <i>r(z)</i>.The Young-Laplace
equation can be written in order to describe the capillary pressure in the
absence of gravity inside the fracture as follows [41]:</p>

<div class="equation">
<img src="001_MTTP_files/eqn1.png" class="eqn" width="130">
<div class="eqn-number">(1)</div>
</div>

<p class="body">where <i>p<sub>cf</sub></i>
is the fracture capillary pressure (or pressure difference across the
gas-liquid interface), <i>&#963;</i> is the gas-liquid surface tension, and <i>R<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>R<sub>2</sub></i>
are the radii of curvature of the curved bridge surface at any point and can be
expressed as below [41]:</p>

<div class="equation">

fracture. The parameters used in this figure are defined in the text.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p class="body">For our case, the Young-Laplace
equation relates the curvature of the gas-liquid interface to the fracture
aperture size, the gas-liquid surface tension, and the fracture capillary
pressure caused by the pressure difference between liquid and gas in the
fracture. In the absence of gravitational field, the mean curvature of the
bridge surface [(1/<i>R<sub>1</sub></i>) + (1/<i>R<sub>2</sub></i>)] will be
the same at any point of the interface [26,27].</p>

<p class="body">Eq. (1) along with
Eq. (2) leads to a nonlinear 2<sup>nd</sup>-order ODE. The boundary conditions
are established from the contact angles between the gas-liquid and the faces of
the upper and the lower matrix blocks. Schubert [25] detailed the solution of
combined Eqs. (1) and (2) by transformation into either a 1<sup>st</sup>-order
ODE or an integral equation. He also reviewed other efforts to solve Eq. (1)
subject to Eq. (2). Schubert [25] provided graphical solutions to relate the
capillary force, the contact angle and the volume of the liquid bridges for
various configurations of grains. Firoozabadi and Hauge [27] used Schubert's
graphical solutions [25] to find the capillary pressure as a function of
saturation for fractures and spheres surrounded by flat plates.
Hernández-Baltazar and Gracia-Fadrique [34] showed that the Young–Laplace
equation of differential form can be solved under an elliptic representation
for a fluid-fluid interface in the coordinate range of 0 to 90°. They found a
simple analytical relation between the curvature radius and the elliptic
parameters, which is applicable for drops and bubbles with elliptical and
spherical shapes, while in this work an analysis of the Young-Laplace equation
in terms of two dimensionless parameters is presented to investigate the shape
of the liquid bridge in a horizontal fracture between two matrix blocks.</p>

<p class="body">Since the fracture
capillary pressure gives the pressure difference between liquid and gas in the
fracture, it is possible to write it as:</p>

<div class="equation">
<img src="001_MTTP_files/eqn3.png" class="eqn" width="250">
<div class="eqn-number">(3)</div>
</div>

<p class="body">Capillary pressure
plays a significant role when two phases are in contact. Knospe and Nezamoddini
[35] investigated the shape variation of a liquid bridge in a microactuator
based upon the alteration of the capillary pressure within a conducting liquid
bridge via the application of electric potential.</p>

<p class="body">Let <i>r<sub>c</sub></i>
be the radius of the line of contact of the liquid bridge interface with the
faces of the blocks, which is called the contact radius, and <i>r<sub>0</sub></i>
the radius at <i>z</i> = 0, which is called the neck radius. Using two dimensionless
variables, <img width=50 height=20 src="001_MTTP_files/text1.png"> and
<img width=73 height=19 src="001_MTTP_files/text2.png">,</i>
Eq. (2) can be re-written in the following form:</p>

</div>


<p class="body">where &alpha; is a dimensionless
term, defined by <sub><img

<p class="body">Using Eq. (14),
the profile of <i>z<sub>D</sub></i> versus <i>r<sub>D</sub></i> for a fixed value

Integral (14) cannot be integrated analytically; therefore, it is integrated

demonstrates the shape variation of liquid bridges between two porous matrix

to vary, its central radius (the radius at <i>z</i> = 0, <i>r<sub>0</sub></i>)
reduces while the contact radius of the liquid bridge interface with the faces
of the blocks remains fixed. The coordinate which represents the situation of
the liquid bridge interface with the top plate in the first quadrant is <i>r<sub>Dc</sub>

liquid bridges is symmetric because gravity was not considered.</p>

<p class="body">For application of
interest, the stability of liquid bridges between porous matrix blocks can play
a significant role in oil recovery from naturally fractured reservoirs. Some
factors such as axial flow from an upper matrix block, discharging through a lower
matrix block and fracture roughness affect the stability of liquid bridges and
make it complex to study and analyze. Including these complexities in
determination of the shape variation of liquid bridges in a fracture needs
further investigation. However, <span style='font-family:"Cambria","serif";

experimental works in this area.</p>

<h4>4. Summary and Conclusions</h4>

<p class="body">Formation of
liquid bridges can cause capillary continuity between porous matrix blocks,
improve oil drainage from naturally fractured reservoirs and affect contaminant
migration in fractured rocks. This paper presented a theoretical study of the static
shape of liquid bridges. Here, a new dimensionless analysis of the
Young-Laplace equation is developed, in which the shape of the liquid bridge
surface can be written in terms of <i>&#945;</i> and<i> &#946;</i> as defined
dimensionless parameters. For a limiting case with zero gravity an integral
describing the gas-liquid interface variation of a liquid bridge is obtained
which has been solved numerically. The analysis presented may be useful for a stability
analysis of perturbed liquid bridges subject to axial flow from an upper matrix
block and discharging through a lower matrix block in fractured porous media.</p>
